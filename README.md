# Deploying a Local ReactJS UI Integrated with Strapi API

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a local ReactJS application and integrate it with a Strapi API. The ReactJS frontend fetches and displays content from the Strapi backend, providing a seamless development experience. This guide covers setting up the Strapi content type, fetching data using Axios in React, and displaying this data in a styled React component.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Strapi installed globally (`npm install strapi@latest -g`)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Strapi Content Type

1. **Create a Strapi Content Type**: Ensure your Strapi backend has a content type with fields for `title`, `summary`, and `content`.
2. **Add Some Content**: Use the Strapi admin panel to add some entries with these fields.

### Step 2: Create and Set Up the ReactJS Application

1. **Create a New React Application**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-strapi-react-app
   cd my-strapi-react-app
